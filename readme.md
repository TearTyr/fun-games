## READ THIS BEFORE USE
- To avoid softlocks, turn off `Kill Aura` while doing quests.
- **Important:** This script requires **administrator privileges** and will prompt for elevation if needed.
- The launcher automatically manages the log blocker.
- You can choose to run the game with DirectX 11 at launch, with an option to always use it.
- the skip splash intro is always active.

## HOW TO USE
1. Download the [latest version launcher](https://github.com/TearTyr/fun-games/releases).
2. Extract it, place it in a folder, and run `launcher.exe` as administrator.
3. Select your `Wuthering Waves Game` folder.
4. If needed, select your game version (Global/CN).
5. If you haven't set a preference, you'll be prompted to choose whether to run the game with DirectX 11 (Yes/No/Always).
6. While in the login menu showing `MOD LOADED`, you can open the menu with `ALT + X`.

## LOG BLOCKER (Automatically Managed with Manual Option)
The launcher automatically enables the log blocker when you launch the game and disables it when the game closes. It displays the current status of the log blocker in the main menu. The launcher will notify you when the game closes that mods are being removed and logs are being unblocked.

**Manual Management (Optional):**
If you prefer to manage the log blocker manually:
- Open the directory `Wuthering Waves\Wuthering Waves Game\Client\Saved`.
- Open the `Logs` folder and delete all files inside with the `.log` extension.
- Right-click the `Logs` folder and select `Properties`.
- Go to the `Security` tab and click `Edit`.
