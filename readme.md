# 2.0
Source Code: [Waves Mod 2.0](https://github.com/saefulbarkah/wuthering-wave-mod)

## READ THIS BEFORE USE
- To avoid softlocked, Turn off `Kill Aura` while doing Quest.
- **Important:** The script now requires **administrator privileges** and will prompt for elevation if needed.
- The launcher can now automatically manage the log blocker.
- You can now choose to run the game with DirectX 11 at launch, with an option to always use it.

## HOW TO USE
1. Download [latest version launcher](https://github.com/saefulbarkah/fun-games/releases)
2. Extract it, and place it in a folder, and run `launcher.exe` as administrator.
3. Select `Wuthering Waves Game` folder.
4. If needed, select your game version (Global/CN).
5. If you haven't set a preference, you'll be prompted to choose whether to run the game with DirectX 11 (Yes/No/Always).
6. While in login menu showing `MOD LOADED` you can open menu with `ALT + X`

## LOG BLOCKER (Automatically Managed with Manual Option)

The launcher now automatically enables the log blocker when you launch the game and disables it when the game closes. It also displays the current status of the log blocker in the main menu. The launcher will inform you when the game closes that the mods are being removed and logs are being unblocked.

**Manual Management (Optional):**

If you prefer to manage the log blocker manually, you can still do so:

- Open directory `Wuthering Waves\Wuthering Waves Game\Client\Saved`
- Open folder `Logs` delete all inside with file named .log
- Right click on folder `Logs` click properties
- Go to `Security tab` click edit
